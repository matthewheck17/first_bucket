# first_bucket

First Bucket is a web app that I developed to show the first basket scorer for each team in each nba game. This web app scrapes espn for data and retrieves the first scorer from each nba game and inserts it into a database. This data is displayed via php, html, and css for easy viewing. Here is the link to check it out: https://www.matthewheck.me/first_bucket/home.html
